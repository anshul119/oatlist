# [OatList]

Oatlist fetches the list of users form OAT list users API. It has been made with React with TypeScript.

By using interfaces and models the application is strongly typed making it very easy to catch the errors, beauty of TypeScript. I used Styled Components to style the components.

Webpack takes care of all the bundling and other necessary build tasks.

## Getting Started

For running development build on localhost please install node modules by runnins `npm i` and then run the webpack dev server `npm run serve`.

Head to `localhost:8000` to see the app.
